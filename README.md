# LeetTest
LeetTest is a web extension which automatically generates test cases for Leetcode problems. LeetTest also provides other quality of life features to make solving problems less frustrating and more rewarding.

## Features  
- **Random Test Case Generator**  
  LeetTest will generate unique code for each problem, ensuring that the generated test cases follow problem constraints and are useful for debugging code. Generated code is stored in an SQL database and is retrieved upon request to minimize API calls.    

- **Numeric Difficulty Ratings**  
  LeetTest uses [CLIST's](https://clist.by/) API to provide fine-grained, numeric difficulty ratings rather than "Easy", "Medium", and "Hard".  

- **Live Company Tags**  
  Company tags are provided for common questions and appear below the difficulty, allowing users to target certain companies for practice.

To install the extension, download it from [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/leettest/diinamlcdbbpfebknmhajjaijpflnaoe?authuser=0&hl=en) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leettest/). Then, navigate to any LeetCode problem, open the extension, and press "Generate Testcases".
